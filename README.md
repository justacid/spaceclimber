# SpaceClimber

A small endless climber game I've written for a game jam a
few years ago. It was hacked together on two evenings - though
I cleaned it up just a little, using modern C++14. I also rewrote
the asset handling. Previously assets were bundled in a custom 
archive file format, loosely based on FAT32, but it turned out to
be kind of a pain, since there was no real tooling. I therefore
moved to bundling the assets in a ZIP-Archive. The art was
done by me, the music is royalty free stuff found on the web.
Assets are available [here](https://github.com/justacid/spaceclimber/releases/download/v.1.0/assets.zip).
